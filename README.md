# cs50-assignments
This repository contains assignments written in Python, C and SQL for the online cs50 course on EdX.

Over the course of around 8 weeks, I have covered - 
- Arrays, functions, variables and their scope
- Linear and Binary search, Bubble, Selection and Merge sort, Recursion
- Memory concepts - Pointers, File Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Stacks, Custom Types, Hexadecimal
- Data Structures - Linked lists, trees, tries, hash tables, dictionaries, queues

I simultaneously learnt to use these concepts and code in C, Python and SQL. 
Most code is written by me - some parts of the Python and C assignments were pre-written by the teaching staff which I completed as required. These have also been graded - I can share the link to their grades as well.
